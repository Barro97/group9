**JavaScript Pages:**

We created a JS page for each page, where we performed validations according to the document, various adjustments for design purposes, dynamic changes to the page, printing or pop-up messages according to the page.

**Additional Notes:**

- We used various JavaScript libraries to enhance the functionality of the application, such as Bootstrap and jQuery.
- The application is implemented in a modular way, which makes it easy to maintain and extend.
